# carlpch
This is an R package I built to write some useful functions with the goal of improving readability and saving myself some time while doing data manipulation. Currently, there are only two functions, as shown below: 

## `replace_all()`

## `rownonmiss()`

In particular, `rownonmiss()` is motivated by the same function in `STATA`. In order to run the package, `dplyr` is required.
