# carlpch
This is an R package I built to write some useful functions with the goal of improving readability and saving myself some time while doing data manipulation. 

## Installation:
Please install `devtools` (`install.packages('devtools')`) before running the commands below to install this package:
`devtools::install_github("carlpch/carlpch")`

## Package contents:
Currently, there are only two functions, as shown below: 

## `replace_all()`

## `rownonmiss()`

In particular, `rownonmiss()` is motivated by the same function in `STATA`. In order to run the package, `dplyr` is required.
